I always partake in the fun [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) event every December. In the past I've published my solves on github in their own repositories, and figured it's time to just have one main repo to work in every year. 

I almost always do the inital solve in Python but occasionally branch out and practice other languages. 

Spoilers within, of course.
